The Configuration class reads a configuration file in YAML format and stores 
the values for query.

To use the class include the file SioxConf.h and define the global variable 
"config" as follows:

----
#include "SioxConf.h"

Configuration *config;
----

you can query the configuration data for a module using the function:

	Module get_module_conf(std::string module_name);

It returns a structure of type Module containing all the configuration options
for the corresponding module. (See Configuration.h)

Not all of the YAML syntax is supported at the moment. Take a look at the file
siox.conf inside the global test directory to get an idea about how to write
a config file.

In order to compile the class you will need the version 0.3 of the YAML-CPP 
library, which should be available in most Linux distributions.
