To use sublime together with cmake / ninja some preparation is needed:
$ cd siox
$ ln -sf devel/sublime/siox.sublime-project siox.sublime-project 
$ mkdir build/
$ cd build
$ cmake -GNinja ../

To change configuration options:
$ ccmake ../ 

Now select Tools/Build System/Ninja in Sublime.

Alternatively to manual cmake: start Sublime press CTRL-SHIFT-P select "BUILD: Configure", now it should run cmake...
Now you can use F7 or CTRL-B to build the project and F4 to walk the errors.



OLD:

To setup sublime to build with waf:

$ cp waf-sublime ../

open sublime, preferences, browse packages
go to C++ folder

copy C++.sublime-build into this folder replacing the old file.

Now you can use F7 or CTRL-B to build the project and F4 to walk the errors.
