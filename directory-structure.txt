Public interfaces are placed under:
include/<package>/<component>/<interface>.h[pp]
include/siox-ll/monitoring.h,optimization.h

All component implementations are derived from:
include/core/component/component.hpp

Rationale:
* All these files offer global and mandatory interfaces for all implementations.
* These files should be installed globally to allow everybody to write a new implementation against these interfaces.


Implementations:
<package>/<component>/module.h # Contains the interfaces required for the given component. All implementations of the given component should include this file.
<package>/<component>/<implementation>/module.c
<package>/<component>/<implementation>/<implementation>_<interface>.[c|cpp]
<package>/<component>/<implementation>/test/test.cpp
