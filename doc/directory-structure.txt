The primary directory structure is:
devel -- contains functionality needed for building and helping during the development process
doc -- basic documentation and root directory for building documentation
src -- main folder for source
tools -- additional tools, i.e. to automatically create wrappers.
         These tools must be build manually, thus they are not included in the main build process of SIOX.

For developers (we are talking about the src/ directory)
========================================================

Public interfaces are placed under:
include/<package>/<component>/<interface>.h[pp]
include/siox-ll/monitoring.h,optimization.h

All component implementations are derived from:
include/core/component/component.hpp

If you are interested to develop your own component read the component.hpp for a description.

Rationale:
* All these files offer global and mandatory interfaces for all implementations.
* These files should be installed globally to allow everybody to write a new implementation against these interfaces.


Implementations:
<package>/<component>/module.h # Contains the interfaces required for the given component. All implementations of the given component should include this file.
<package>/<component>/<implementation>/module.c
<package>/<component>/<implementation>/<implementation>_<interface>.[c|cpp]
<package>/<component>/<implementation>/test/test.cpp

Documentation:
* is provided inside the header files for the interfaces and in the implementations
* required images / uml diagrams etc. are located in
** doc/<package>/<component>/
