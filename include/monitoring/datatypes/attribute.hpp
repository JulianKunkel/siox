/**
 * USE CASES
 * =========
 * 1 - A cache component needs to store info on its capacity.
 * 2 - An activity needs to store info on one of its call parameters.
 * 3 - A remote call needs to store info on one of its call parameters.
 */

/**
 * REQUIREMENTS (and the use cases they are based on)
 * ============
 * 1 - Hold a system-unique attribute id (AtId).
 * 2 - Hold the attribute's value in a custom-tailored memory chunk (void *).
 * 3 - Possibly remember how much memory is being used by value (size_t).
 * 4 - Remember whether attribute serves as a descriptor here (bool).
 * 5 - Possibly allow for access to attribute via its (fully qulified?) name instead of AtId.
 */

/**
 * DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
 * =====================
 *
 */

/**
 * OPEN ISSUES
 * ===========
 * 1 - Allow for access via name? If so, how?
