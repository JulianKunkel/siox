The first part of this readme is optional, it describes the usage of the siox-wrapper. The necessary files to compile the program are already generated.

--- OPTIONAL PART ---

0. -- Generate the header file

First a clean header file of the HDF5 lib has to be created. The clean header
file only contains the required includes and the function definition of the
parsed header file. The clean header file will be annotated with the commands
from the template.

-b create a clean header file
-t the template which will be used
-o name of the output file

  ../../siox-wrapper.py -b -t ../../template.py -o hdf5.h /usr/include/hdf5.h

Add the necessary includes at the beginning of the hdf5.h file.

  #include <hdf5.h>

It is possible to add additional includes in the template with the includes
variable. Multiple includes of the same header file will be filtered.

Now the commands of the template can be used to instrument the code.
In this example C code is added before and after the H5Fcreate function call.
All other HDF5 function have been deleted for clearness.

splice_before adds C code before the HDF5 function call
splice_after adds C code after the HDF5 function call

  // splice_before printf("SIOX: Call H5Fcreate.\n");
  // splice_after printf("SIOX: H5Fcreate terminated.\n");
  hid_t H5Fcreate(const char *filename, unsigned flags, hid_t create_plist,
  hid_t access_plist);

1. -- Generate the source code

The C source code file of the library can be generated in two ways, with the
ld.so of the linker (dlsym) or the wrapper functionality of the gcc (wrap).

To generate the C source with dlsym (default):

-t provide the template
-o output file

  ../../siox-wrapper.py -t ../../template.py -o hdf5-dlsym.c hdf.h


To create the C code for the instrumented library with the gcc wrap
functionality:

-s wrap the style which should be used to generate the C code (default dlsym)

  ../../siox-wrapper.py -s wrap -t ../../template.py -o hdf5-wrap.c

The siox-wrapper prints the name of the function prefixed with the wrap
parameter to let the gcc know which function should be wrapped. This output
must be passed to gcc. The compile-wrap.sh already contains the
necessary list.

--- END OPTIONAL PART ---

2 -- Build the wrapped program

Depending on how the C code is generated it's possible to build the wrapper
source code as a shared library or link the program directly against the
wrapper source code.

2.1 -- Build the library wrapper as a shared library (default)

To build the wrapper code as a shared use:

  ./compile-dlsym.sh

This shell script generates a shared library hdf5.so out of the hdf5-dlsym.c
f ile. And compiles the test program filter-test.

2.2 -- Link the program directly to the wrapper

This method uses the gcc wrap functionality.

  ./compile-wrap.sh

This script generates the test program filter-test-wrap which is directly
linked against the wrapper code.
The wrap option of the gcc has the disadvantage that the executable needs to
be rebuild.

3 -- Call the test program

3.1 -- Call filter-test with the generated shared library

To call filter-test with hdf5.so:

  LD_PRELOAD=./hdf5.so ./filter-test

It is possible to load multiple instrumented libraries.
If the posix example is already build it is possible to load this library
to and trace the path of the I/O even further.

  LD_PRELOAD="./hdf5.so ../posix/posix-dlsym.so" ./filter-test

3.2 -- Call filter-test-wrap


  ./filter-test-wrap

LD_PRELOAD is not needed any more because the program is directly linked against the wrapper code.
