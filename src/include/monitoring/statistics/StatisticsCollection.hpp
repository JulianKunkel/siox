/**
 * @file StatisticsCollection.hpp
 *
 * StatisticsCollections can be used to get a consistent view of the values of Statistics provided by different plugins.
 * It works largely like an array of a fixed size.
 * If the StatisticsCollection is created as threadSafe, calls to pushValues() and fetchValues() are serialized.
 * However, if the consumer is known to live in the same thread as the producer, the locking overhead can be avoided by passing false to the threadSafe parameter.
