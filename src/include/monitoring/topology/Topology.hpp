/*
The topology is used to locate any node/device/software component within a cluster.

These objects are connected via parent/child relations, each child has a unique name in the context of its parent.
All objects must have at least one parent, the only exception is the root object which has none.
This root object may be retrieved by calling `lookupObjectById(0)`.
The parent/child relationships may be used to lookup an object by a given path, specifying a sequence of child names starting from the root object.
Since objects may have multiple parents, it is possible to look up the same object from different paths.
XXX: Do we need to add a facility to generate paths? I. e. something like `enumeratePaths( ObjectId )`? I hesitate, because then we would need to ensure that this method would not explode when an object is its own grandfather. And that's a very common use case.

All objects and relations have a type, which is simply a string describing the kind of object/relation.
Example types for objects would be: node, block device, NIC, Network-Switch, etc.
Example types for relations are: includes, connects to, runs on, etc.

Objects may be connected to attributes that add further description.
The attribute itself is just the abstract concept of an attribute that includes a datatype for the values,
an example would be: Bandwidth (MB/s), double.
Values store a concrete value for an Attribute/Object combination.

XXX The following might need to change, should the need arise to store a reference to a relation or a value.
Both, the relations and the values have no identifier of their own, but use a combination of two members as a unique key.
Consequently, their use is a bit more implicit than the use of types, objects, and attributes.
This is especially true for values, which only become explicit when an object is asked to enumerate its attributes.



Use cases:
	U1	Store and retrieve static system information like which nodes/devices/connections/deamons/etc. the system consists of.
	U2	Talk about any part of the system by using a unique ID.
	U3	Implement an ontology using the abstractions provided by the topology (simple code reuse, because describing the topology requires more powerful abstractions than the ontology).

Requirements:
	R1	U1 => Relations between objects must be representable, and it must be possible to enumerate them.
	R2	U2 => It must be possible to lookup objects by their ID.
	R3	U3 => Attributes must consist of a name and a domain.
