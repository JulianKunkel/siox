This document describes where and how to get information about a compute node.

Hostname:
gethostname()

CPU Vendor:
Read from /proc/cpuinfo

CPU Model:
Read from /proc/cpuinfo

Virtual CPU Core Count:
Read from /proc/cpuinfo

Physical CPU Coire Count:
Read from /proc/cpuinfo


--- The next entries apply to each core available on the node. ---

CPU Core Available Scaling Governors:
All scaling governors available on the node.
Read from /sys/bus/devices/cpu($coreid)/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors

CPU Core Scaling Governor:
Current chosen governor.
Read from /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu($coreid)/cpufreq/scaling_governor

CPU Core Hardware Min Freq:
Read from /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu($coreid)/cpufreq/cpuinfo_min_freq

CPU Core Scaling Min Freq:
This is minimal frequency set by the governor.
Read from /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu($coreid)/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq

CPU Core Hardware Max Freq:
Read from /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu($coreid)/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq

CPU Core ID:
Read from /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu($coreid)/topology/core_id

CPU Core Siblings:
Read from /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu($coreid)/topology/core_siblings_list

CPU Core Thread Siblings:
Read from /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu($coreid)/topology/thread_siblings_list

--- Each core has access to multiple caches. ---

Cache Level:
Read from /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu($coreid)/cache/index($indexnr)/level

Cache Size:
Read from /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu($coreid)/cache/index($indexnr)/size

Cache Shared CPUS:
Read from /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu($coreid)/cache/index($indexnr)/shared_cpu_list

Cache Type:
Read from /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu($coreid)/cache/index($indexnr)/type

--- Enough about the cpu. Gather information about attached pci devices. ---

To get the attached PCI devices Parse the output of "lspci"
and store the found devices in the database.

Read the network devices from /sys/class/net

To map the device to the entry in lspci have a look at the symlink, it
contains the PCI address.

--- Information about network devices. ---

This is a example for a Ethernet device.

Address:
Read from /sys/class/net/($device)/address

Duplex Mode:
Read from /sys/class/net/($device)/duplex

Operation state:
Read from /sys/class/net/($device)/operstate

Seed:
The speed can only be read when the operstate is "up"
Read from /sys/class/net/($device)/speed

--- Information about block devices. ---

Search for devices in /sys/class/block

Scsi Level:
Read from /sys/class/block/($device)/device/scsi_level

Vendor:
Read from /sys/class/block/($device)/device/vendor

Cache Type:
Somethink like "write back"
