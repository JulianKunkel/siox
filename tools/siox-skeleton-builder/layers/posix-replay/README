Example for instrumentation

About instrumentation

Any function available in the "blank" header file (generated by siox-wrapper
with the -b option) can be instrumented. This is done by adding a one-line
comment before the function definition, followed by the name of the function to
use (matching the template) and its parameters separated by spaces
(for example "// function_name para1 para2").
Some general rules apply here. First of all, the order of the commands is
maintained. So you can rely on variables you defined before. Another important
feature is quoting, you can have spaces in single parameters if you quote them.
If more parameters than expected are given, any spare ones
are assigned to the last parameter (with the spaces between them).
Lastly, comments which are not to be parsed can be added with /* Comment */.
