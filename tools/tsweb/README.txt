To use this pages you need a web server supporting PHP and PHP's PEAR module "graphviz".

You can install PEAR using the package manager in your Linux (zypper, apt, etc.) distribution. 
The graphviz module can be installed using the following command:

pear install Image_GraphViz

Additionally you also have to adjust the config.php file inside the include directory.
